    <p>Chess is a board game for two players. It is played in a square board, made of 64 smaller squares, with eight squares on each side. Each player starts with sixteen pieces: eight pawns,
      two knights, two bishops, two rooks, one queen and one king. The goal of the game is for each player to try and checkmate the king of the opponent. Checkmate is a threat ('check') to 
      the opposing king which no move can stop. It ends the game.</p>

      going to need them. You should focus on learning the concepts behind the opernings. Some of the most consequently used openings for white are:
      Kings gambit, Queen's gambit, Ruy Lopez and the English. For black a common but  good openings are: Sicilian defence, French defense,
